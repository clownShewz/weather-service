# weather-service
Simple REST service using Express hosted on an AWS Lambda using API Gateway to wrap a call to the dark sky API. 
There is a lot more to build out here but I needed something for a Free Code Camp exercise to get weather data. 

Dark Sky has a great API and really wanted to used that in my weatherPage.
